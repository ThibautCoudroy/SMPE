- In the last 8 years, the concept of Open Data grew a lot into the academic field.
- (Bias) No full explanation of the ~1000 responses "screen out during the data-cleaning process" or "irrelevant to some repspondents"
- (Bias) May have a bias in the translation, but at the same time translating may reduce bias from everyone translating themselves
- (Bias) in proportion of fields or countries? Or adapted to research done in the field?
- Scientists feel a lack of recognition of sharing data
- Where is the 3/4 from, for the support question??
- I did not expect those results for the motivations of sharing data (Lot of people do it for citations / co-authorship and financial reward). More and more people do it for financial reward as we can see in the chart of the next page.
- Did not expect this much scientists using ChatGPT for data collection/processing (>10%)
- I didn't expect data begin new to be taken into this much (>60% find it pretty important that it is less than one year old)
- ~10% are uncomfortable with their data being used for different questions
- There are solutions to store and share datasets, but not well known by everybody. One aim is to get solutions well known for better open science
- Most people curate their data before sharing even privately
- Much variance between countries about data mandate
- Age does not seem to impact results
- (Bias) Only 11% of respondents do not share data
- Cost of data sharing may be a stop
- More and more scientists are implementing a DMP (Data Management Plan)
- LLM can help research, by better indexing (whereas keywords has its limits) and finding the good questions according to the data
- There are high differences between countries, cultural & laws

- European Union requires open access to data to research it funds. Other initiatives exists at different scales (France, ...)
- Article contains some resources for databases online
- RDM seems to be quite important to establish at the beginning and makes it clear for the whole study
- I didn't know publication cost was this high (thousand euros for an article??)
- Exclusivity embargo of a few months (6 or 12), but then article may be published on open archive if > half publicly funded
- Peer review had issues which could be resolved with open data (pagiarism, not knowing the subject, ...) and sharing different info (peers not anonymous anymore for example)
