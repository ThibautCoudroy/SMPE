#### Data
- [x] Type of graphic adapted

#### Graphical objects
- [ ] Graphical objects are readable on any support
- [X] Standard color range
- [X] Axis identified and labelled
- [X] Scales units are explicit
- [ ] No ambiguity when curves cross
- [ ] Grid helps reading

#### Annotation
- [X] Axis are labelled by quantities
- [X] Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained
- [ ] Units are indicated on the axis
- [X] Axes are oriented fron bottom-left to top-right
- [X] Origin should be (0,0), if not it should be clearly justified
- [X] No Hole on the axes
- [ ] the order's of graph/histogram bar is based on classical ordering 
- [x] Curves and Bar has legend

#### Information
- [x] Curves on the same scale
- [ ] Less than 6 curves
- [x] Compare curves on same graphics
- [x] A curve cannot be removed without reducing infos
- [x] The graphic gives relevant infos
- [ ] It is not possible to remove object without altering readability

#### Context
- [x] All symbols used are defined and references
- [ ] The graphics is the most appropriate representation for the data
- [x] The graphic has a title
- [x] The title is meaningful and self contained

(I feel like I was not able to show through the checklist that it's very hard to see which tone of color is in each segment)
