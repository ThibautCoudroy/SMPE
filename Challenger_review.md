# What was wrong with the analysis for Challenger spaceship?

When reading about the Challenger joints data analysis, multiple mistakes can be seen and lead to a wrong conclusion.
First of all, the data used for the statistics was not taken fully into account. Crucial and important data were ignored, while they have a meaning and an impact about the analysis. Every experiment without malfunction was discarded but it was in fact crucial to know is which condition tests were successful.
This lead to an interpretation of a "linear" probability, independant of temperature, and interpreted as having no difference between low temperature (31°F) and others. The uncertainty was not at all taken into account but it tells use that we should trust much the linear aspect of the probability.
Moreover, only using statistics to predict the physical behaviour of the joints is also wrong because some temperatures could bring big differences. For example, 31°F is around the freezing temperature of water so a lot of changes could happen.

This tragedy shows us that a lot of mistakes can happen in statistics and every assumption can lead to different results. Hypothesis have to distort reality as least as possible.

We can still ask ourselves other questions about the analysis and how to improve it. For example, we should maybe only take into account experiments for which the pressure is around the same of the one experienced the day of the launch.
