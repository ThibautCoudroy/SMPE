## Homework

- [ ] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.
- [ ] Use dplyr and ggplot for the first/last name analysis! Complete challenger if you haven't done so.
- [ ] If you have time, git a try to git-annex but no worry if you can't. What's important is that you know it exists, what it allows to do, and that it is not so difficult to use.
- [ ] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and choose a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).
