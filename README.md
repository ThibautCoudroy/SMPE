## Homework
- [x] Read Popper's text
- [x] Indicate your name on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#). You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.
- [x] Register on the [Mattermost](https://framateam.org/smpe-2023-2024/channels/town-square).
- [x] Set up a *public* github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
- [x] Register to the [MOOC](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/) on Reproducible Research
- [x] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the [MOOC](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/) with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on Challenger; watching interviews is optional)
- [x] Set up a computational document system (Jupyter).
- [x] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#).

## Homework

 - [x] Start learning R by reading this [R crash course for computer scientists](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2022_10_Grenoble/R_crash_course.html)
 - [x] Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc's slides by:
  1. Applying the checklist for good graphics
  2. Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist
 - [x] Report this work for at least 3 figures here
 - [X] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (/Challenger/). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.

## Homework

- [X] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.
- [X] Complete the Challenger exercise if you haven't done so.
- [X] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and choose a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).
- [X] Here is an opportunity to practice your data curation/analysisskills by producing the [First name/last name analysis in a computational document](https://github.com/alegrand/SMPE/blob/master/sessions/2022_10_Grenoble/03_Names-Methodo2022-exercise.Rmd). I encourage you to use dplyr and ggplot for this analysis.
